    * Users can claim chunks for their clan. The chunk must attach an other chunk which is already claimed.
    * Users can allow special abilities in their land like building, destroying, interacting for different ranks and in specific chunks
    * There are taxes for your region per chunk and member amount.
* War:
    * Allow enemies to destroy and interact in your clan land
    * There is a one chunk inside of your region you can set, your home-chunk. If warring clans stay a amount of time in this chunk
      they get money from the clan or conquer chunk per chunk, maybe randomly.
